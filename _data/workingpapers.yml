        summary: |
            Workers differ ex-ante in their ability to find a good match. Firm can either learn match quality during hiring, or on the job. A worker protection policy that makes layoffs more difficult makes hiring more risky. The model features a screening externality: the more firms screen, the worse the applicant pool, the more important screening.
