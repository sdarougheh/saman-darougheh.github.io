        summary: |
          Job-to-job transitions are (wage) inflationary and decrease vacancy posting, thereby challenging the traditional view on the relationship between inflation and unemployment. The model explains the effects of the 2012 Danish reform on employment transitions and wage growth.

        summary: |
          We compute income-specific price indices to deflate nominal incomes and wages in the United States. We study the evolution of real wages and real family income since 2020. We find a convergence of real wages, but a divergence of real income.

        summary: |
            Workers differ ex-ante in their ability to find a good match. Firm can either learn match quality during hiring, or on the job. A worker protection policy that makes layoffs more difficult makes hiring more risky. The model features a screening externality: the more firms screen, the worse the applicant pool, the more important screening.
