        summary: |
          Job-to-job transitions are (wage) inflationary and decrease vacancy posting, thereby challenging the traditional view on the relationship between inflation and unemployment. The model explains the effects of the 2012 Danish reform on employment transitions and wage growth.

      - title: "Getting Real About Wages: A Nonhomothetic Wage Deflator"
        conference: ES Winter Meetings 2025
        authors: <a href="https://phhoc.github.io/">Philipp Hochmuth</a>, <a href="https://www.marciasilvapereira.com/">Márcia Silva Pereira</a>, <a href="https://www.markuspettersson.net/">Markus Pettersson</a>

        summary: |
          Conventional real wages—nominal wages divided by a consumption deflator—are biased from a welfare perspective when households value leisure and exhibit nonhomothetic consumption behavior. We derive a true wage deflator and show that standard measures underestimate real wage growth and welfare growth between 1984 and 2019. Our deflator leads to similar conclusions as the conventional CPI deflator when studying the evolution of wages during the post-Covid inflation surge.

        summary: |
          US surveys on occupations contain a lot of mistakes. We estimate these mistakes and show that they not only lead to false estimate of whether an occupational change occurred, but also how far it was.  Miscoding can also be informative about occupational distance itself, since closely-related occupations are more likely to be miscoded into each other.



      - title: "Why are marginal workers unemployed: low productivity or high outside options? (conditionally accepted, Labour Economics)"

            caption: Marginal workers are a small share of the Danish labor force. Yet, due to their large average unemployment rate, they make up a large share of total unemployment.
        conference: 5th Dale T. Mortensen Conference, SED 2024
        summary: |
            15% of Danes ("marginal workers") make up two thirds of unemployment. Are they less productive, or do they have better outside options (=enjoy unemployment more)? I answer this using both administrative records and a model calibration.

      - title: "Why VAT Pass-Through Varies Across Countries: The Role of Market Power"
        authors: <a href="https://www.tiagobernardino.com/">Tiago Bernardino</a>, <a href="https://pedrobrinca.pt/">Pedro Brinca</a>, and <a href="https://www.marciasilvapereira.com/">Marcia Silva-Pereira</a>

            caption: "The figure plots country-level average HHI (employment-weighted) against pass-through estimates. Circle size is inversely proportional to the variance of the first-stage estimate and thus reflects its precision. The estimated coefficient is -0.13 with a p-value of 0.089. The R2 is 0.16."
        conference:
        summary: |
            The pass-through of value-added taxes depends on market concentration. European countries differ significantly in their average market concentration, which explains 16% of the cross-country differences in VAT pass-through.

      - title: "Danish Flexicurity and Occupational Mobility: A Comparison with the United States"
        authors: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/carloscarrillotudela/">Carlos Carrillo-Tudela</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ludosresearch/">Ludo Visschers</a>
        summary: |
            We compare Danish occupational mobility rates -- occupation by occupation -- to that in the United States, taking care of miscoding in the latter. We find significantly lower gross and net mobility in Denmark.

      - title: "Workplace Amenities and the Gender Wage Gap: Evidence from Denmark"
        authors: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/alexanderdietrich">Alexander Dietrich</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jonna-olsson/">Jonna Olsson</a>
        summary: |
          We use a rich set of individual-level amenities to show that gender-differences in amenity selection (even within narrowly defined occupations) affect the gender-wage gap.

            summary: |
              Business cycle accounting suffers from two implementation issues that can severely bias conclusions. Log-linearization creates substantial measurement errors during large fluctuations, while variable-specific deflation violates the methodology’s theoretical foundations.
