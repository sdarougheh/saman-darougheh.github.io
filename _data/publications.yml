        summary: |
            Recessions that generate more mismatch do not inherently generate more unemployment. I show this modelling "broad" 
            occupations -- that are employable in many industries, and thus less at the risk of mismatch. The model also suggests 
            the average broadness of the unemployed as a useful measure of mismatch.

        summary: |
            Credit-card transaction data are popular when sharp economic changes need to be monitored in real time. 
            Yet, because of input-output linkages, sectoral output responses are very different from what the sectoral consumption data implies.
