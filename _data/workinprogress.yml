        summary: |
            We compare Danish occupational mobility rates -- occupation by occupation -- to that in the United States, taking care of miscoding in the latter. We find significantly lower gross and net mobility in Denmark.

        summary: |
            In the aftermath of the pandemic, many countries subsidized prices of essential goods via lower VAT, arguing that subsidizing essential goods is an effective way to support low-income households. Is it? We answer this question taking seriously both non-homothetic preferences and an imperfect pass through of VAT.

      - title: "Better the Devil You Know: Women's Job Mobility and the Hidden Risks of Workplace Change"
        authors: Alexander Dietrich
        summary: |
            We document: women care more about workplace-related amenities than men; these are less prevalent in male-dominated occupations; women's job mobility is lower in these occupations, and their job changes coincide with higher wage growth. We rationalize these findings with a job-ladder model in which social amenities are unobservable prior to accepting a job.

        summary: |
            Workers differ ex-ante in their ability to find a good match. Firm can either learn match quality during hiring, or on the job. A worker protection policy that makes layoffs more difficult makes hiring more risky. The model features a screening externality: the more firms screen, the worse the applicant pool, the more important screening.
