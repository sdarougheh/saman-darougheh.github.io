        summary: |
          US surveys on occupations contain a lot of mistakes. We estimate these mistakes, provide a way to fix them, and learn about distances between occupations (closely-related occupations are more likely to be mistaken).

            caption: Marginal workers are a small share of the Danish labor force. Yet, due to their large average unemployment rate, they make up a large share of total unemployment.
        conference: 5th Dale T. Mortensen Conference
        summary: |
            15% of Danes ("marginal workers") make up two thirds of unemployment. Are they less productive, or do they have better outside options (=enjoy unemployment more)? I answer this using both administrative records and a model calibration.

        summary: |
            Job-to-job transitions drive wage inflation. Therefore, fiscal policy that disincentivizes on-the-job search can lower inflation without rising unemployment. We show that such fiscal policies have bite using changes in the Danish income tax brackets.   




      - title: "Non-homothetic preferences and relative price shocks"

        summary: |
            In the aftermath of the pandemic, many countries subsidized prices of essential goods via lower VAT, arguing that subsidizing essential goods is an effective way to support low-income households. Is it? We answer this question taking seriously both non-homothetic preferences and an imperfect pass through of VAT.
