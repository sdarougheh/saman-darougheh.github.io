        summary: |
            Employment has increased significantly in Denmark, the euro area and the US during the post-pandemic expansion, with stronger growth relative to GDP than in previous expansions. Employment growth is due to several reasons. One of them is a fall in real wages: when labor is cheap, more of it is employed -- especially less-skilled workers.

        summary: |
            Unemployment risk is highly heterogeneous in Denmark: a group of marginal workers constitutes 15 per cent of the labour force but makes up roughly 60% of the unemployed in Denmark. These marginal workers cycle more through jobs, have longer and more frequent spells of unemployment and leave their jobs at higher pace. Empirical evidence suggests that they are less productive, and more dependent on labor income.

        summary: |
            Using micro-level data from the period 2001-2018, we document the increased digitalisation of the Danish economy and analyse the effect of digitalisation on sectoral and firm performance measured by sales. Within sectors, large firms that increased their usage of digital goods  on average grew faster in terms of sales. We examine the evolution of the workforce in the IT sector and we find that workers have become more specialised over the last decade. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that this higher specialisation is associated with higher productivity; however, it might reduce the resilience of the IT labour market against economic shocks. 


      - title: Three lessons from the Danish wage compensation scheme

        summary: |
            The three lessons: First, less educated workers have in general been more affected by the crisis. This is mainly driven by the type of firms that are affected by the crisis, and not the decisions of individual firms. Second, a firm's choice to keep, lay off or furlough workers is also driven by the worker's attachment to the workplace. Firms lay off workers with fewer hours and employees with short employment spells, while workers with high seniority are furloughed. Third, workers earning more than peers face a greater risk of being laid off, while firms furlough workers that are less expensive.
